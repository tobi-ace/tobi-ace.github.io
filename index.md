### Enefit: Forcasting energy bahaviours of prosumers
The goal of this challenge is to create an energy forecasting model for prosumers to reduce energy imbalance costs.
Energy imbalance is a situation where the energy expected to be used doesn't line up with the actual energy used or produced. Prosumers, who both consume and generate energy, contribute a large part of the energy imbalance. Despite being only a small part of all consumers, their unpredictable energy use causes logistical and financial problems for energy companies. 
This forecasting model was build on real world data from prosumers in Estonia

### Offensive language detection with BERT (Deep NLP)
Offensive language detection is an automated NLP Task of determining the existence of offensive language in a piece of text. In this project, I will be using a PyTorch classifier built on a pre-trained BERT model to detect offensive language in text

### Youtube Question Answering with Sentence Transformers
Question answering is the unique ability of ML models to retreive specifc piece of information from a larger pool of information based a user given prompt. In this project I am building a Youtube question answering system that can answer question based on the content of a Youtube video using sentence trasformers
