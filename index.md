### Youtube Question Answering with Sentence Transformers
Question answering is the unique ability of ML models to retreive specifc piece of information from a larger pool of information based a user given prompt. In this project I am building a Youtube question answering system that can answer question based on the content of a Youtube video using sentence trasformers
